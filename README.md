# DECIDE: Launch Interceptor Program

## Description
Program for a anti-ballistic missile system that gives True or False signal for intercept based on radar data. 

This project is based on the development of a function called DECIDE() as part of a hypothetical anti-ballistic missile system. The function generates a True or False signal to determine whether an interceptor should be launched based on input radar tracking information. It evaluates a set of Launch Interceptor Conditions (LICs) using inputs like planar data points, a Logical Connector Matrix (LCM), and a Preliminary Unlocking Vector (PUV), to produce a Final Unlocking Vector (FUV) for the launch decision.

## Essence
The team is currently in the "In place" stage. The team is currently close at finishing the first assignment and have agreed upon several practises and is used by all members to complete their respective work. However the team has agreed that there still is room for improvement to the methods and practises used by the team members. The team is planing on having some sort of retrospective meeting after the assignment to gather concrete solutions to issues such as improved methods for reviewing pull requests. Some of the points in the checklist is not really relevant for this exercise, the points in state "Principles Established" that use the word stakeholders is not really relevant for this type och project since there is not really any external party that has an intrest on the performance of this project. We assesed that we are in the state "In place" since the previus stages are completed. We have completed the "Principles Established" state since we have addressed the principles and constraints of way-of-working. The team has addressed the "Foundation
Established" stage and decided the basic methods for working such as communication methods, meeting times and tools. In addition to this the team has identified that there is a gap in testing knowledge. We also have started to use these practises and tools to start working and made significant progress in the first assignment. This leaves us at the state "In place" where the team is mainly waiting for the oppertunity to gather our feedback and adapt the of the way-of-working for the next assignment.
